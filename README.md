# SDG Game Prototype
I created this game prototype as a part of an intake assignment to Saxion University of Applied Sciences. It is inspired by one of the Sustainable Development Goals: "Life below water". The goal of the player is to collect as much plastic as possible throughout two levels.


## Features and Mechanics
The game features two levels:
* On the first level player needs to collect items and carry them to the trashbin to add them to the total score. The player can carry only 2 items "in hands". 
* On the second level player can move only on x-axis and needs to collect as many items as possible within the time limit. 

There is a timer on both levels. When the timer ends on Level 1, Level 2 starts automatically. After time runs out on Level 2, the third scene shows the score for both levels and gives an opportunity to retry the game.
